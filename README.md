This is must read document to run the program

## How to initialize

This process is written assuming that you have pulled this repository from github.

If you never installed next js or node js then first you should download node js file from below url
```
nodejs.org
```

First, cd to root of the project. Root directory name is "info2222-p2"
cd
Then run the following commands one by one 

```bash
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial
```

After this your .env should only have
```
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```
If it is not like this just force make file named ".env" under project root and just put above line into the file and save it

By this initial setting, the database is empty, thus, to login and use the functionalities, it requires to register user and send friend request to do the 1 on 1 chatting.


## Getting Started

To run the program functionaly, 2 programs commands should be ran in 2 different terminal

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

then to run the real time server run the following command on another terminal

```bash
npm run socket
```
